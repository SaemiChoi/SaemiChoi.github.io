Hi :smile: ! 
I'm a Staff Engineer at [Think Tank Team](https://thinktankteam.info/), Samsung Research. 
I completed my PhD in Interdisciplinary Information Studies at University of Tokyo, 
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Kiyoharu Aizawa](https://www.hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~aizawa/) on affective systems for font and image.
My graduate study was generously supported by [Japan Government (MEXT) Scholarship](https://www.mext.go.jp/en/index.htm).
During my PhD studies, I participated AI Research Internship program at [Naver corp.](https://clova.ai/) (2018)
and worked on Ad design policy project at Multimedia group. 
I also spent time at Multimedia and Human Understanding Group (MHUG) at University of Trento (2017) and worked on font-image pairing
with [Nicu Sebe](https://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/) funded by the [European Commission](https://www.emhrpp.com/)

My research interest is to support effective communication between humans and systems and leverage
user experience in the use of the systems by using multimedia processing techniques.
I love to work on problems related to Affective Computing, and also deeply engaged in machine learning.
